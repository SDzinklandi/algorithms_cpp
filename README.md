# algorithms_cpp

The Project algorithms_cpp includes some of the most used algorithms for data structures and sorting. 
The algorithms can be used as an idea for your own algorithms and modifications.

### Implemented Algorithms:
#### Data Structures:
- Priority Queue

#### Algorithms:
##### SPECIALS
- Route Navigation with A-Star Algorithm! Uses the Manhatten-Heuristic!
